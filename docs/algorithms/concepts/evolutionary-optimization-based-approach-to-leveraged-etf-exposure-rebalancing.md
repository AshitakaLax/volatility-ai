## What this page covers

The CSV rates every member *Low confidence — reconstructed from the
algorithm title; executable rules and source support are not
established.* The member names (for example "Evolutionary Scholarly
Leveraged ETF Rebalancer Alpha-43") combine a method word, "Scholarly",
a task and a serial number, and the rows' references are software
libraries or papers the CSV's own review calls unrelated. There is no
specific algorithm behind each name to research, so this page researches
what the members share: the task, done with the method.

## In one paragraph

Hold a target exposure through a leveraged ETF, rebalancing as the daily
reset and the path of returns pull the realised leverage away from
target, net of costs. The evolutionary version searches parameters or
weights with genetic algorithms. I found no study of this method on this
task.

## The CSV's description

Proposed evolutionary-optimization-based approach to leveraged-ETF
exposure rebalancing: Adjust exposure to maintain a specified
leveraged-ETF allocation or target exposure, while accounting for
daily-reset effects, path dependency, and transaction costs. This is a
concept-level interpretation of the title, not a complete trading
specification: the exact model inputs/target, calibration, entry/exit or
rebalance rules, and position sizing are not fully defined here.

## Evidence

* **Avellaneda & Zhang (2010), "Path-Dependence of Leveraged ETF
  Returns," *SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics* 1, 586–603:** the
  gap between a leveraged ETF and a static leveraged position is driven
  mainly by the underlying's realised variance; fees and funding are
  predictable. (Abstract and author slides.)
* **Cheng & Madhavan (2009), "The Dynamics of Leveraged and Inverse
  ETFs," *Journal of Investment Management*:** daily rebalancing makes
  leveraged ETFs path-dependent and creates end-of-day rebalancing flows
  in the direction of the day's move (see C-MS6). (Paper; cited in the
  ledger.)
* **Gayed & Bilello (2016), "Leverage for the Long Run":** hold leverage
  above the index's 200-day average and T-bills below it; volatility,
  which erodes daily-reset leverage, clusters below the average. The
  repository's measurement of the same switch carries a same-session
  lookahead (V16, R1). (Paper summary in
  `docs/research/correction-strategies.md`.)

## Against, and failure modes

* Volatility decay is a property of the path, not a forecastable edge:
  rebalancing toward a target chooses how much leverage to hold, it does
  not remove the decay.
* A target-exposure rule and a lot-harvesting grid pull in different
  directions; every sale still has to pass the no-loss guard.
* A genetic search over a backtest is a large multiple-testing exercise
  that finds the noise that fits best.

## Fit with volatility-ai

This is the project's home ground. The engine trades TQQQ and already
varies its exposure three ways: volatility targeting (V18), the leverage
step-down between TQQQ and QQQ (N7) and the SMA leverage switch (V16).
An exposure rule here is a sizing lever on the grid, not a separate
strategy.
