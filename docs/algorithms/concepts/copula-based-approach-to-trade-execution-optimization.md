## What this page covers

The CSV rates every member *Low confidence — reconstructed from the
algorithm title; executable rules and source support are not
established.* The member names (for example "Copula-Based Scholarly
Execution Trajectory Optimizer Ver-9") combine a method word,
"Scholarly", a task and a serial number, and the rows' references are
software libraries or papers the CSV's own review calls unrelated. There
is no specific algorithm behind each name to research, so this page
researches what the members share: the task, done with the method.

## In one paragraph

Plan order timing and slicing over a horizon to balance slippage,
impact, completion risk and liquidity. The copula-based version models
joint and tail dependence between assets separately from each asset's
own distribution. I found no study of this method on this task.

## The CSV's description

Proposed copula-based approach to trade-execution optimization: Plan
order timing and slicing over an execution horizon to balance expected
slippage, market impact, completion risk, and liquidity. This is a
concept-level interpretation of the title, not a complete trading
specification: the exact model inputs/target, calibration, entry/exit or
rebalance rules, and position sizing are not fully defined here.

## Evidence

* **Almgren & Chriss (2001), "Optimal execution of portfolio
  transactions," *Journal of Risk* 3(2):** the mean-variance trade-off
  between impact and timing risk for a large order (see RK366).
  (Standard reference.)
* **Frazzini, Israel & Moskowitz (2018), "Trading Costs" (SSRN
  3229719):** on $1.7 trillion of live institutional trades, market
  impact averaged under 9 bp for orders completed within a day, an order
  of magnitude below earlier estimates. (Abstract and summaries.)

## Against, and failure modes

* Execution schedules address impact, which is a few basis points even
  for institutional orders (Frazzini, Israel & Moskowitz).
* Copula families and parameters are hard to pin down from the few joint
  extremes the data hold.

## Fit with volatility-ai

The engine's orders are small against TQQQ's volume; slicing schedules
solve a problem this book does not have (RK363, RK366). A spread gate
(RK244) covers what matters.
