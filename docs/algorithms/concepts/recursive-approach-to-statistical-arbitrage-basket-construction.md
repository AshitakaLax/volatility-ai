| Task | Statistical-arbitrage basket construction |
| Method | Recursive (online) estimation |
| Fit with this project | ⛔ not useful · out of scope or without evidence |
| Useful for volatility-ai | **Not useful.** Market-neutral baskets need short legs, which the owner's rules exclude; the engine trades one ETF long-only. |
| Implemented in volatility-ai | Johansen baskets and related stat-arb rules are research code (`stat_arb`). |

## What this page covers

The CSV rates every member *Low confidence — reconstructed from the
algorithm title; executable rules and source support are not
established.* The member names (for example "Recursive Scholarly
Statistical Arbitrage Basket Ver-51") combine a method word,
"Scholarly", a task and a serial number, and the rows' references are
software libraries or papers the CSV's own review calls unrelated. There
is no specific algorithm behind each name to research, so this page
researches what the members share: the task, done with the method.

## In one paragraph

Score relative mispricing across a basket and build hedged,
market-neutral positions, subject to borrow, liquidity and costs. The
recursive version updates its estimates one observation at a time
(recursive least squares, Kalman-style updates). I found no study of
this method on this task.

## The CSV's description

Proposed recursive approach to statistical-arbitrage basket
construction: Score relative mispricing across a basket of securities
and construct hedged or market-neutral positions, subject to borrow,
liquidity, and transaction-cost constraints. This is a concept-level
interpretation of the title, not a complete trading specification: the
exact model inputs/target, calibration, entry/exit or rebalance rules,
and position sizing are not fully defined here.

## Evidence

* **Avellaneda & Lee (2010), "Statistical arbitrage in the US equities
  market," *Quantitative Finance* 10(7):** mean-reversion trading of
  stock residuals against PCA factors or sector ETFs, hedged long-short
  (see RK33). (Abstract.)
* **Krauss, Do & Huck (2017), *European Journal of Operational Research*
  259(2), 689–702:** an ensemble of deep nets, boosted trees and random
  forests traded S&P 500 stocks long-short at over 0.45% a day before
  costs, with returns declining in recent years. (Abstract.)

## Against, and failure modes

* Stat-arb returns have declined as the trade crowded (Krauss et al.
  2017).
* Hedged baskets need short legs, borrow and many names.
* A recursive estimate needs a forgetting rate: too slow lags, too fast
  is noise.

## Fit with volatility-ai

Hedged, market-neutral baskets need short legs; the owner's rules are
long-only and the engine trades one leveraged ETF. Out of scope as a
strategy.
