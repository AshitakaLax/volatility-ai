## What this page covers

The CSV rates every member *Low confidence — reconstructed from the
algorithm title; executable rules and source support are not
established.* The member names (for example "Quantum-Inspired Scholarly
ETF Rotation Engine Ver-93") combine a method word, "Scholarly", a task
and a serial number, and the rows' references are software libraries or
papers the CSV's own review calls unrelated. There is no specific
algorithm behind each name to research, so this page researches what the
members share: the task, done with the method.

## In one paragraph

Rank a defined ETF universe by momentum, trend or risk and rotate on a
fixed schedule, with a defensive asset and a cost model. The
quantum-inspired version solves the problem with a classical algorithm
modelled on a quantum one (annealing, tensor networks). I found no study
of this method on this task.

## The CSV's description

Proposed quantum-inspired approach to ETF rotation: Rank a defined ETF
universe using a specified momentum, trend, or risk signal and rotate
exposure on a fixed schedule, with a defined defensive allocation and
trading-cost model. This is a concept-level interpretation of the title,
not a complete trading specification: the exact model inputs/target,
calibration, entry/exit or rebalance rules, and position sizing are not
fully defined here.

## Evidence

* **Faber (2007), "A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset
  Allocation":** a 10-month moving-average filter across asset classes
  gave comparable returns with much lower volatility and drawdown (see
  RK17). (Summaries.)
* **Antonacci (2012, published 2017), "Risk Premia Harvesting Through
  Dual Momentum":** relative strength picks the asset, absolute momentum
  against T-bills decides whether to hold it (see RK3). (Paper summary.)

## Against, and failure modes

* Rotation results depend heavily on the universe and the rebalance day;
  many published variants are fitted on the same few decades.
* Momentum-based rotation lags turning points and whipsaws in sideways
  markets.
* Quantum-inspired solvers compete with exact classical ones that, at
  this size, already find the optimum.

## Fit with volatility-ai

Built as X3 (relative-strength rotation), X2 (defensive rotation), RK3
(dual momentum) and C-E2 (Faber TAA), none yet measured. A rotation
sleeve sits beside the TQQQ grid.
